# Real-Time Dynamic Destruction 

This project was created as part of my dissertation piece for my BSc Games Software Engineering course. 
It explores techniques for real-time, dynamic destruction, demonstrating real-time capabilities.

## About the Project
This work aimed to implement realistic and interactive destruction mechanics using optimized rendering techniques. 
It serves as a deep dive into the challenges of simulating destruction shapes in real-time with 3D models in applications such as modern-day games and simulations.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenGL** (via **GLEW**) for rendering.
- **SDL2** for window management and input handling.
- Custom physics algorithms for raycasting and mesh collisions.

## Features
- Real-time breaking of objects with dynamic shape generation.
- Efficient rendering pipeline optimized for performance.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Developed expertise in OpenGL and low-level graphics programming.
- Designed and implemented real-time mesh handling and manipulation.
- Explored optimization techniques for performance budgets within modern games.

## Further Development
This project laid the groundwork for my ongoing interest in low-level graphics and engine development.
